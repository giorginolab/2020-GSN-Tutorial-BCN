This is a Python notebook, based on Google Colaboratory platform. For an introduction to the platform, see [here](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb). You will be able to edit Python statements on this notebook by entering them into "cells", and execute them with the "play" button.

Notes:
 * The order of execution matters, not the order of display. 
 * To start from scratch, restart the runtime. 
 * Shell commands: prefix with an ! symbol.  E.g. `!ls -l` lists the contents of the current directory.
 * If you don't have a Google account, you may copy-paste the  statements in  local Python installations.
 * To plot, see examples [here](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/charts.ipynb).

The exercise is based on the following paper:

Camilloni (Springer, ISBN 978-1-4939-9608-7).  [Preprint here](https://github.com/giorginolab/preprints-repository/tree/master/analysis_libraries_chapter).

Based on the biological example from:
